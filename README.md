Creating a React Native app with video streaming capabilities involves a few steps. Here's a basic outline of what you'd need to do:

Prerequisites:
React Native Setup: Ensure you have React Native set up on your system. You can follow the official React Native documentation for installation instructions.

Video Player Library: i haved installed a video player library for React Native. Some popular options include react-native-video,

Steps:
Create a New React Native Project:
Use npx react-native init VideoApp to create a new React Native project named VideoApp.

Install Video Player Library:
Depending on the library you choose, follow the installation instructions provided by the library's documentation.

Design UI:
Create a series of lists (maybe using TouchableOpacity,Text,View or other components) to display video thumbnails or titles. Tapping on a video should navigate to a screen where the video player is displayed.

Implement Video Player:
Use the chosen video player library to embed the video player in the app. You'll need to fetch the video data (e.g., video URLs) and pass it to the video player component.
and i import video url from demo api.

Add Video Controls:
Implement features like play, pause, forward, backward by using the controls provided by the video player library. 
Testing:
Test the app on an emulator/simulator or a real device to ensure that the video playback and controls are working correctly.
